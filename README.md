MicroMouse Simulator

Instructions:
1. Install
2. Use File/Open in the menu to select a .map file from the application directory
3. Select Run in the menu. Application will run through sixteen direction preferences compiling data for each run. This will take anywhere from 2-5 seconds depending on the speed of your computer.
4. All sixteen direction preferences are selectible from the menu. Some direction preferences are more desireable than others based on run statistics.

In addition to the .map files located in the installation directory, you can create and simulated your own .map files (additional instructions will come at a later date)
